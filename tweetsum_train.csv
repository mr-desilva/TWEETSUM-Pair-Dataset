Got told today that a similar bag got left so that's who probably has mine. I've got the majority of my clothes in it and want them back asap. support: We're sorry, Dan. If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up we're not responsible for contacting them on your behalf. However, if there's been a bag left behind we'll do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it. ^Julie customer: When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar. They said you can't return theirs until mine has been returned. It's a bit annoying that you can't contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake. What are my options? support: Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration. Unfortunately, we're unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know. You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company. ^Linds customer: So people can just get off your flights and take whatever baggage they want? great that is!!

If another passenger has your bag, you wouldn't be able to make a claim with us. You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them. ^Kev customer: So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person who's bag was left and ask. Obviously I would but you wouldn't be able to give me their details. I've got presents etc in the bag and no money to replace them now, so it's essentially ruined my Christmas. support: We wouldn't be able to give you their details for data protection reasons, Dan. We can't guarantee we can do anything, as your bag arrived on the carousel. However, please DM us your baggage ref, email and postal address. ^Leanne customer: Hi Leanne I've sent the message thanks Dan","Someone else has taken their bag after a flight and left their own similar case and wants to know when BA will contact the customer, also asks when they can make an insurance claim.

96," customer: the 2120 Salisbury train from Waterloo. Not really getting much info guys.... customer: So it was incorrectly coupled?? Really???? Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors ""magically worked"". Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out. support: On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 1/3 support: team's fault-finding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The train's fail-safe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 2/3 support: Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using on-board monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action. ^DB 3/3 customer: So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train it's not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? That's your statement? support: On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a ""pull-away"" test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100+ contacts on the train 1/3 support: type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of fail-safe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 2/3 support: which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically. ^DB 3/3 customer: Whilst I'm still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! :) support: No worries - I'm ex train-crew, so this is rather my specialist topic!

    support: Hi Thamin, if you arrived after check-in for your flight had closed we wouldn't be able to accept you for the flight. Even if the airport is quiet, check in times still need to be met. ^Natalie customer: Natalie I was 5min late. Plane wasn't expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, (would guess the plane was too)I'm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help. support: Hi Thamin, I'm afraid this isn't something we can offer any flexibility with. It's not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesn't allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when it's 1/2 support: busy. I can understand your disappointment, but it's your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes. ^Beth S. 2/2 customer: Just for clarification 🤔- so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin? Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please. customer: And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late check-ins? support: We're sorry, Thamim. If you follow this link, it does advise you  Click check in essentials.

However, once check in has been closed, we're unable to reopen a passenger list. We hope you understand we have to be fair and consistent with all of our passengers. 1/2 support: This means our staff wouldn't have been able to make an exception when you travelled. We hope this message helps to clarify our position. 2/2 ^DaniH customer: Thank you for the response- but it doesn't suffice and is unacceptable, you're flights are always delayed and customers get no compensation. You also make different exceptions for different people it seems support: EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim. Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control. We're sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised it's your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 1/2 support: airport and check in, in time for your flight. We're unable to hold a flight for a passenger if they are late. Our position remains unchanged. ^Natalie 2/2 customer: Natalie - do me favour, let's quantify this: how long on average it takes to get from checkin desk to the furthest boarding gates at T5? customer: And for the record I wasn't asking you to hold a flight, the plane wasn't due to leave for 50min (and it was still delayed by 20min) support: Hi Thamin. It can depend on a lot of factors.  We appreciate you may not have been asking to hold the flight. If you're late to check in, there isn't any way for you to make the flight, even if the flight is delayed. We're sorry you remain disappointed with our response. ^Paul",The customer says that he would have been allowed for check in since he was delayed by only 5 minutes.

596," customer: Been with AirBnB for 4+ years as traveler &amp; superhost.  Booked on  for thanksgiving with parents, but listing was misleading (e.g., dumpster at front door, bad/dangerous condition).   
  support: Hi Mostafa, we apologize for any frustration. We've asked a member of our team to review your case and follow up with you asap. Please be on the lookout for their contact. Thank you. customer:  I've spent multiple hours speaking w/ CS team. Case manager disputes that listing is misleading &amp; says it is good condition (whereas other 2 reps were also appalled at pics I sent).  Clearly case manager doesn't care abt customers, focused on not giving refund. customer:  Honestly, I am still shocked that this is even something I need to further pursue. I could hear the case manager struggling to say it is not a misleading post and disgusting apt, but he didn't want to issue refund and said it.  Pics again as a reminder of the quality of place.  customer:  AirBnB Policy: ""If you are a Host, you are responsible for ensuring that the Accommodations you list on Airbnb meet minimum quality standards regarding access, adequacy of Listing description, safety, cleanliness""  

I guess exposed electrical outlets are not a safety issue?!?!  customer:  I suppose dumpsters at building entrance, holes in floor, rusted faucets and dirty bathroom vents fall within ""minimum quality standards"" for cleanliness?  customer:  Does picture on listing with amazing view vs. the actual view from living room of dumpster (see pics) fall within the ""adequacy of Listing description""?!  Am I missing something? Host didn't follow multiple minimum quality items but u don't care since you got your money.  support: Hi Mostafa, a member of our team is currently reviewing the situation and will be following up shortly. We appreciate your patience during this process. Please feel free to DM us with any specific questions you might have in the meantime. customer: yeah, you said that yesterday &amp; same case manager reached out with same (ridiculous) conclusions.  I disputed transaction with credit card company and they will follow up with you.  I can appreciate bad experiences happen, but your response has been really shocking!  support: We understand your frustration. Our dedicated team is currently reviewing the case once again and they will follow up with you as soon as they can. Thank you for your patience. customer:  AirBnB still not willing to refund.  Any self-respecting company would have issued a refund and apologized profusely given the dirty place, let alone the safety issue with exposed electrical outlets.  Pictures again to remind you of what AirBnB thinks is ""acceptable""  support: We have issued our final decision on this matter. Please refer to the email thread that we have been corresponding with you. Rest assured your feedback has been recorded, Mostafa. customer: I have, but am unable to get in touch with the CS rep.  The final decision is unacceptable.  I can keep tweeting to let others know about ur company's horrible service - maybe they can learn from my experience and share pics of the disguisting place you guys think is acceptable.  customer: What exact feedback has been recorded?  The host STILL has his misleading picture of Union Square as the first pic on his rental units which actually overlook an alleyway with dumpsters.  If you haven't amended that, then you obv. don't care at all about user experience.",Customer complaints about listing being misleaded. Agent assures customer that his feedback has been recorded.
